She's never been able to see her lush forest home, but she knows its secrets. She knows how the shadows shift when she passes under a canopy of trees. She knows how to hide in the cool, damp caves when the Scourge comes. She knows how devious and arrogant the Groundlings' tree-dwelling neighbors, the Lofties, can be. And she's always known this day would come--the day she faces the Scourge alone. The Sightless, like Fenn, are mysteriously protected from the Scourge, the gruesome creatures roaming the forests, reeking of festering flesh and consuming anything--and anyone--living. A Sightless Groundling must brave the Scourge and bring fresh water to the people of the forest. Today, that task becomes Fenn's. Fenn will have a Lofty Keeper, Peree, as her companion. Everyone knows the Lofties wouldn't hesitate to shoot an arrow through the back of an unsuspecting Groundling like Fenn, but Peree seems different. A boy with warm, rough hands who smells like summer, he is surprisingly kind and thoughtful. Although Fenn knows his people are treacherous, she finds herself wanting to trust him. As their forest community teeters on the brink of war, Fenn and Peree must learn to work together to survive the Scourge and ensure their people's survival. But when Fenn uncovers a secret that shatters her truths, she's forced to decide who and what to protect--her people, her growing love for Peree, or the elusive dream of lasting peace in the forest.

He eventually makes the cut as an extra for Satan's Alley (billed as a musical trip through Hell) and immediately sets his sights on the show's snooty prima-donna star (Finola Hughes, decidedly unsuited for such dancing as her role requires). Meanwhile, the nice girl he's been seeing (Cynthia Rhodes) stands by her man, waiting patiently for him to come around. When the male lead can't cut it, Tony is offered the part, and tensions rise.

DAR Ancestor #: A045712 #R##N##R##N#GLOVER, John, soldier, was born in Salem, Mass., Nov. 5, 1732. He raised a regiment of 1000 men, chiefly hardy sailors and fishermen, residents of Salem and Marblehead, and marched with them to Cambridge, where he was of great service to Washington in organizing and drilling the new army. He was given command of his recruits, organized as the 21st regiment, afterward known as the 14th, distinguished as the model regiment of the Continental army and known as the amphibious regiment by reason of the former calling of the men. When the army retreated from Long Island, Glover manned the boats and ferried the entire army across the river. His regiment also manned the boats when Washington crossed the Delaware river to attack the British army at Trenton, N.J. He was present at the battle of Stillwater; shared with Washington the hardships of Valley Forge; was appointed brigadier-general, Feb. 21, 1777; served under Schuyler at Saratoga, and conducted the army of Burgoyne as prisoners of war across the country to Cambridge, Mass. He was with General Greene's division in New Jersey in 1778; was in Rhode Island under Sullivan in 1779; was superintendent of drafts in Massachusetts in 1780; and a member of the Andr\u00e9 court of inquiry at Tappan, N.Y,, Sept. 29, 1780. William P. Upham of Salem, Mass., prepared an interesting memoir of him, published in 1863. He died in Marblehead, Mass., Jan. 30, 1797. from The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans: Volume IV #R##N##R##N#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glover_(general)#R##N##R##N#John Glover (November 5, 1732 \u2013 January 30, 1797) was an American fisherman, merchant, and military leader from Marblehead, Massachusetts, who served as a Brigadier General in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.#R##N##R##N#Early life #R##N##R##N#Glover was born in Salem, Massachusetts, the son of a house carpenter. His father died when he was four years old, and shortly thereafter his family moved to the nearby town of Marblehead. As a young man, Glover became a cordwainer and rum trader and eventually a ship owner and merchant. He married Hannah Gale in October 1754.#R##N##R##N#Following the Boston Massacre in 1770, Committees of Correspondence were formed. Marblehead elected Glover along with future revolutionists Elbridge Gerry and Azore Orne to committee posts. After the First Continental Congress passed the non-importation agreements sanctioning trade with the British, Glover was elected to enforce the embargo as a member of the committee of inspection.#R##N##R##N#Military career #R##N##R##N#Glover was active in the militia for many years before the Revolution, with his earliest service dating back to 1759. In 1775 he was elected lieutenant colonel of the 21st Massachusetts Regiment from Marblehead, and became commander of the unit after the death of Colonel Jeremiah Lee in April 1775. Glover marched his regiment to join the siege of Boston in June 1775. At Boston, General George Washington chartered Glover's schooner Hannah to raid British supply vessels, the first of many privateers authorized by Washington. For this reason the Hannah has been called the first vessel of the United States Navy.#R##N##R##N#The Marblehead militia or Glover's Regiment became the 14th Continental Regiment. This regiment became known as the amphibious regiment for their vital nautical skills. After Washington lost the Battle of Long Island in August 1776, Glover's Marbleheaders evacuated the army to Manhattan in a surprise nighttime operation, saving them from being entrapped. In subsequent actions of the New York campaign the regiment fought well against the British at Kip's Bay and Pell's Point. The last action of the regiment was its most famous: ferrying Washington's army across the Delaware River for a surprise attack at Trenton in December 1776. The regiment was disbanded as enlistments expired at year's end.#R##N##R##N#Glover went home to tend to his sick wife and look to business affairs. He turned down a promotion to brigadier general in February 1777, but rejoined the war after a personal appeal from General Washington. He served in the successful Saratoga campaign in 1777 and the failed Battle of Rhode Island in 1778. He was stationed along the Hudson River for the remainder of the war, guarding against British moves up the river from NYC.#R##N##R##N#Later life#R##N##R##N#Hannah, Glover's first wife, died in 1778. He married again in 1781 to Frances Fosdick. He retired from the army in 1782 in poor health. Failing to secure a job with the U.S. federal government, he served in various local offices in his remaining years. He died at age 64 in Marblehead, Massachusetts, after contracting hepatitis and was buried in Old Burial Hill (Marblehead, Massachusetts).#R##N##R##N#Memorials#R##N##R##N#Various things have been named in his honor.

He came from a family involved with the visual arts: his older brother Joseph (1816\u20131892) and his son L\u00e9opold (1866\u20131935) were painters, while another brother Arthur (1825\u201399) was an art dealer and critic. His father, who had fought in the Napoleonic wars in the army of William I of the Netherlands, was an art collector who owned several watercolors by <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix>Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix</a>, among other artists. His mother's parents ran Caf\u00e9 de l'Amiti\u00e9 in Brussels, a meeting place for politicians, writers, and artists. All the Stevens children benefited from the people they met there, and the social skills they acquired in growing up around important people. ; ;After the death of his father in 1837, Stevens left middle school to begin study at the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/acad-mie-royale-des>Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts</a> in Brussels, where he knew Fran\u00e7ois Navez, the Neo-Classical painter and former student of <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david>Jacques-Louis David</a> who was its director and an old friend of Stevens's grandfather. Following a traditional curriculum, he drew from casts of classical sculpture for the first two years, and then drew from live models. In 1843, Stevens went to Paris, joining his brother Joseph who already was there. He was admitted to the <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/cole-des-beaux-arts>\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts</a>, the most important art school in Paris. Although it is said that he became a student of its director <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres>Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres</a>, this is likely not true. An early picture by Stevens, The Pardon or Absolution (Hermitage, St. Petersburg), signed and dated 1849, shows his mastery of a conventional naturalistic style which owes much to 17th-century Dutch genre painting. Like the Belgian painter and friend with whom he stayed in Paris, Florent Joseph Marie Willems (1823\u20131905), Stevens carefully studied works by painters such as <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerard-terborch>Gerard ter Borch</a> and <a href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gabriel-metsu>Gabriel Metsu</a>. ; ;Stevens's work was shown publicly for the first time in 1851, when three of his paintings were admitted to the Brussels Salon. He was awarded a third-class medal at the Paris Salon in 1853, and a second-class medal at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1855. His Ce qu'on appelle le vagabondage [What is called vagrancy] (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris) attracted the attention of Napoleon III who, as a result of the scene in the picture, ordered that soldiers no longer be used to pick up the poor from the streets. Two other paintings he exhibited at the Salon in Antwerp that year, Chez soi or At Home (present location unknown) and The Painter and his Model (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore), introduced subjects from la vie moderne for which he became known: an elegant young woman in contemporary dress and the artist in his studio. In 1857, Stevens made his first important sale to a private collector, when Consolation was bought for a rumored 6,000 francs by the Berlin collector and dealer Rav\u00e9n\u00e9. At the same time, he and his brother were becoming part of the art world of Paris, meeting people such as the Goncourt brothers, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, and Alexandre Dumas at the salons of Princess Mathilde as well as popular caf\u00e9s. In 1858, Stevens married Marie Blanc, who came from a rich Belgian family and old friends of the Stevens's.

Sighting the height of a landmark can give a measure of distance off and, held horizontally, a sextant can measure angles between objects for a position on a chart. A sextant can also be used to measure the lunar distance between the moon and another celestial object (such as a star or planet) in order to determine Greenwich Mean Time and hence longitude. The principle of the instrument was first implemented around 1731 by John Hadley (1682\u20131744) and Thomas Godfrey (1704\u20131749), but it was also found later in the unpublished writings of Isaac Newton (1643\u20131727).

Kirk has won every major award in broadcast journalism, including four Peabody Awards, three duPont-Columbia Awards, fifteen Emmy Awards, two George Polk Awards, and eleven Writers Guild of America Awards. Kirk born in Denver, Colorado later moved to Boise, Idaho where he grew up and attended Bishop Kelly High School. He graduated from the University of Idaho in 1971 with a degree in communications.

Other productions include: Losing Iraq, a 90-minute film tracing the U.S. role in the Iraq war from the 2003 invasion to the violent rise of the radical jihadist group ISIS; United States of Secrets: The Program (duPont-Columbia Award, Peabody Award, two Emmy Awards -- including Best Documentary, Writers Guild Award), the dramatic inside story of how the U.S. government came to monitor and collect the communications of millions of people around the world -- including ordinary Americans -- and the lengths they went to trying to hide the massive surveillance program from the public; League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis (Peabody Award, George Polk Award, Writers Guild Award), a two-hour investigation revealing how, for years, the NFL worked to refute scientific evidence that the violent collisions at the heart of the game are linked to alarming incidences of early-onset dementia; Cliffhanger, a look into the nation's fiscal crises and the inside history of how Washington has failed to solve the country's problems of debt and deficit; The Choice 2012 (Writers Guild Award), the quadrennial FRONTLINE special that examines the political and personal biographies of presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney (he also produced the special in 2008, which featured Barack Obama and John McCain, and the 2000 version on George W. Bush and Al Gore); Money, Power and Wall Street (Emmy Award, George Polk Award), the four-hour series that tells the inside story of the financial crisis; Top Secret America (Writers Guild Award), a yearlong examination into the huge, unwieldy, top-secret world the government has created since 9/11; The Anthrax Files, a reinvestigation into the anthrax case a decade after the attacks; and Obama's Deal, a look at the push to reform health care. Prior to Money, Power and Wall Street, he produced three other investigations of the 2008 financial crisis: the Emmy Award-winning The Warning, the unique story of a regulator's warning about the dangers of derivatives in the 1990s; Breaking the Bank, an inside look into the complicated financial and political web threatening Bank of America; and Inside the Meltdown, a major investigation into the collapse of the American economy. In the spring of 2008 he produced, directed and wrote the four-and-a-half-hour, two-part special Bush's War, which won an Emmy and a Writers Guild Award. He has produced ten films on the war on terror, including Cheney's Law (Peabody Award); Endgame; The Lost Year in Iraq (Emmy Award); Rumsfeld's War; The Torture Question (Emmy Award, Writers Guild Award); The Dark Side (Writers Guild Award); The War Behind Closed Doors, an analysis of the political infighting that led to the war with Iraq; and The Man Who Knew, the extraordinary saga of FBI Agent John O'Neill. During Kirk's long relationship with FRONTLINE, he also made the Peabody Award-winning Waco - The Inside Story (1995), a behind-the-scenes look at the FBI siege of the Branch Davidian compound; and the Emmy Award-winning The Kevorkian File (1994), an in-depth examination of Dr. Jack Kevorkian's controversial record and cases.

Death by Fire details the controversial case of one man at the center of the death penalty debate; Caring for Your Parents follows five families caring for their elderly parents; Navy Blues (Emmy Award) examines gender politics in the military; The Way the Music Died goes behind the scenes of the recording industry; and the groundbreaking Misunderstood Minds shares the personal stories of five families confronting the challenges of their children's learning disabilities, filmed over the course of two years. Kirk frequently lectures on topics ranging from current events to issues confronting journalism.

As with most philosophically-driven disciplines, the concept of justice differs in every culture. An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his work The Republic. Advocates of divine command theory say that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like John Locke advocated natural rights as a derivative of justice. Thinkers in the social contract tradition state that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill said that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. Egalitarians state that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a theory of social contract to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like Robert Nozick) take a deontological view of distributive justice and state that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called reparative justice) is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.", "context": "Name the place Justice originated?", "clarification_question": "Do you mean <e> or <e>, when you ask where this person originates? <TSP> thrash metal band Justice <TSP> philosophical theory Justice"}
