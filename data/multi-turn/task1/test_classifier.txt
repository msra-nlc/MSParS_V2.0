David Bowie made popular music for nearly 50 years. He was known for writing innovative, experimental work that was also commercially and critically successful. He is considered one of the most influential rock artists of all time and has had 9 platinum albums in the UK and 5 in the US. He was born David Robert Jones on January 8, 1947, in London, England. He developed an early interest in music and was already playing the saxophone at the age of 13. He soon started a career as a commercial artist, singing and playing with rock bands in his spare time. By 1966 he recorded several singles with three different groups. He eventually set out on his own, first catching the eye and ear of the public in July 1969 with his song Space Oddity. The single became so popular that it reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. The same year, he formed his own mime troupe, Feathers, as well as an experimental art ensemble. This was the time when he adopted the stage name, David Bowie, mainly to avoid confusion with Davy Jones (of pop group The Monkees). Not being as commercially successful as he expected, Bowie inked a deal to record an album, which included the offbeat 'Space Oddity'. Bowie's next effort, 1970s The Man Who Sold the World, was a move toward a harder rock sound. Two years later, he finally made his big breakthrough with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars, a concept album about a sexually ambiguous rock star from outer space. Bowie, who was famous for his campy cross-dressing and different colored eyes, achieved his first major American crossover success in 1976 with the number-one single Fame and the hit album Young Americans. The same year, he also appeared on the big screen in the feature The Man Who Fell to Earth, a film that was a modest box-office success. Next, he teamed up with musician Brian Eno to work on albums called Berlin Trilogy, all reaching the UK top five and receiving lasting critical praise. He truly won the world with subsequent hit singles like Ashes to Ashes (1980), Under Pressure (a 1981 collaboration with Queen) and the several hits spawned by the 1983 album Let's Dance. In the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, his latest studio album The Next Day being released in March 2013. Thanks to his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and eclecticism of his work, he will be best remembered as a major figure in the world of popular music. Unfortunately, David Bowie died on on January 10, 2016 at the age of 69 after an 18 month battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife, the supermodel Iman, who he married in 1992. He also is survived by his son from his first wife, film director Duncan Jones and a daughter Alexandria Zahra Jones who was born in 2000.", "context": "Who are the followers of vortigern, king of the britons? <EOS> Enrique bunbury <EOS> What is the religion of the person?"}

His initial foray into music was the accordion, but he soon made his way to electric bass (and, occasionally, guitar). Cetera's family was Polish in origin, and Peter grew up Catholic. As a youngster, Cetera made the rounds in local bands before landing a gig with The Exceptions. In December of 1967, The Big Thing (later Chicago) and the Exceptions were playing the same place when Cetera approached the former, saying he liked what they were doing. Two weeks later, he'd switched bands. Cetera's addition benefited Chicago in many ways. First, his tenor voice complimented the baritones of guitarist Terry Kath and keyboardist Robert Lamm. Second - and most important at the time - his bass playing simply rocked. Together with Kath and drummer 'Danny Seraphine', Cetera made the rhythm section cook. Although not especially noted as a bass player now, at the time, Cetera set the standard. Early Chicago recordings - such as Listen and Poem 58 - benefit immensely from Cetera's creative lines. But it's as a singer that Cetera is especially noted, and there's no doubt that the man can sing. Questions 67 and 68, 25 or 6 to 4, Just You and Me, and Call On Me all testify to his ability to sing the spots off a tune. His unique vocal phrasing was the result of reconstructive surgery following a fight he got into at a baseball game in 1970. Eventually, Cetera became known as the voice of Chicago. Cetera was the last of the original Chicago members to join, and it's tempting to say that he always felt a bit like an outsider (says trombonist James Pankow, Peter hated the horns). According to Cetera, his early attempts at songwriting weren't well received by others in the band (it must be said these efforts are hit and miss), and by Chicago VII (which was supposed to be all jazz), his frustration was showing. When producer James William Guercio agreed that the VII sessions weren't going well, Cetera offered his compositions Happy Man and Wishing You Were Here - both winners, and both huge hits. Saying he was always the frustrated rocker in the group, Cetera hit home with the almost metal Hideaway on Chicago VIII, a truly inspired bit of writing - tellingly, without horns. Cetera, Guercio, and Kath recorded If You Leave Me Now after the others had finished their work on the Chicago X sessions, and when it hit, it went straight to #1 - the first Chicago single to do so. He scored again on Chicago XI with Baby, What A Big Surprise, even though it was obvious that his contributions on that session were limited (he wrote and sang only that one tune). It was at this time that the group split with Guercio, and that - according to Cetera - both he and Kath were sick of what Chicago was doing. Everything that can go on with a band was going on with us, Cetera has said. When Kath accidentally shot himself early in 1978, Cetera thought the band would end naturally. Doc Severinson talked them out of it. Cetera's bloated and disheveled appearance at this time may be indicative of his feelings about soldiering on. But Cetera soon became the focal point. He was all over the increasingly low selling albums, sometimes penning and singing out-and-out winners (Little Miss Lovin', Loser With A Broken Heart), sometimes penning and singing sappy drivel (Song for You). When Columbia Records dropped Chicago, Cetera jumped on the opportunity to do solo work. His 1981 album Peter Cetera featured his great rocker, Livin' In the Limelight. Cetera became the Man in 1982. The Chicago 16 sessions added keyboardist-guitarist-vocalist Bill Champlin and producer David Foster, but Cetera made the most of the opportunity, penning a funked-up rocker (Bad Advice), and the monster hit Hard to Say I'm Sorry. 1984's Chicago 17 cemented Cetera's position as he racked up the hits You're the Inspiration, Stay the Night, Hard Habit to Break, and Along Comes a Women. The fine work others contributed was usurped by Cetera's popularity, and the break up was inevitable. According to Champlin, Cetera had been thinking about leaving for years: He was ready. He'd quit smoking and drugs, lost weight, and began paying attention to his looks. Cetera says that he wanted to do a Phil Collins/Genesis-type deal, and the others wouldn't have it; others, like James Pankow, say Cetera wanted 50% of the cut, and top-billing (Peter Cetera and Chicago), and they wouldn't have it. Ultimately, according to keyboardist Robert Lamm, Cetera quit, saying, I never really dug the music that much anyway. It was July of 1985. As if in answer, Cetera immediately scored a #1 hit with Glory of Love - which had horns! He followed up with chart busters like After All, (with Cher) One Good Woman, Feels Like Heaven (with Chaka Khan), and has recently re-recorded some of his Chicago hits and a Christmas album. Described as quiet and private, the blond Cetera has been married at least twice. His hair cut in a page-boy early in his career (with the occasional beard), he has stayed slim and GQ recently. Now out of Chicago longer than he was in, he dislikes discussing his years in the group, saying, It's like talking about your ex-wife. He has turned down chances to re-unite with Chicago over the years, and famously refused to allow VH1 to use any of his songs in the Behind the Music episode about Chicago. He has several children, has pretty much quit playing bass, and has only started touring again recently after a long, self-imposed exile. He is, however, accessible on his website, where he answers questions and chats with fans with a great deal of humor and candor.", "entity1": "Manilow, Barry <S> tv.crewmember tv.personality tv.producer tv.writer award.competitor biology.organism book.author broadcast.artist event.agent event.performer film.actor film.music_contributor film.writer internet.social_network_user media_common.cataloged_instance music.artist music.composer music.lyricist music.musician music.producer people.person ratings.rated_entity theater.theatrical_composer tv.actor award.nominee award.winner architecture.structure_owner <S> Barry Manilow Net Worth: Barry Manilow is an American singer and producer who has a net worth of $100 million.

Though projects arranged by Laswell may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically: Material began as a noisy dance music project, but subsequent releases have been centered on hip hop, jazz, or backing spoken word readings by beat generation icon William S.

His legend continued to grow even after poor health and diminished creativity removed him from jazz royalty. Early life Miles Dewey Davis III was born to Miles Davis Jr. and Cleota Henry in Alton, Illinois, on May 25, 1926. There were also two other children, an older sister and a younger brother. In 1928 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis's father became a successful oral surgeon. Davis enjoyed a comfortable childhood and the family lived in a white neighborhood. At the age of thirteen his father gave him a trumpet and soon Davis joined his high school band. While still in high school he met and was coached by his earliest idol, the great St. Louis trumpeter Clark Terry (1920\u2013). After fathering two children by a woman friend, Davis moved to New York City in 1944. He worked for just two weeks in the talent-packed Billy Eckstine Band, then enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music. By day he studied classical music, and by night he gained experience in jazz's newest movement, bebop, with the leaders of the movement, notably Charlie Parker (1920\u20131955), Dizzy Gillespie (1917\u20131993), Fats Navarro, and Max Roach (1924\u2013).  Cool jazz Davis's stint from 1947 to 1948 in a quintet (group of five musicians) led by bebop genius Charlie Parker brought him early fame. A fine bebop trumpeter, Davis soon felt a need to rid his music of bebop's style and to restore jazz's more melodic elements. The result was the influential recording Birth of the Cool (1949), which gave birth to the so-called cool, or West Coast, jazz school. This recording established Davis' musical identity, separate from Parker and the other beboppers. In the early 1950s Davis became a heroin (dangerous drug made from morphine) addict. His career came to a near halt for three years, but his ultimately successful fight against the drug habit in 1954 led to his greatest period: the mid-to-late 1950s. During that six-year span he made a series of small group recordings regarded as jazz classics. In 1954, with tenor saxophone titan Sonny Rollins (1930\u2013), he made memorable recordings of three Rollins originals\u2014Airegin, Doxy, and Oleo\u2014as well as two brilliant versions of the Tin Pan Alley (a respected group of musicians and songwriters) standard But Not for Me. In 1955 Davis formed his most celebrated group, a remarkably talented quintet that featured tenor saxophonist John Coltrane (1926\u20131967), pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. Until Coltrane left in the 1960s, Davis's band was the single most visible and dominant group in all of jazz. In 1964 he put together a new band, and Davis continued to be the greatest attraction (and biggest money-maker) in all of jazz. His new band, however, could not match the impossibly high standards of the original band. Davis, the person For the last two decades of Davis's career he became more of a jazz curiosity than a musician to be taken seriously. A good part of his fame owed less to his considerable musicianship than to his strange personality. Davis gained a poor reputation in performance for turning his back on audiences, for expressing racial hostility toward whites, for dressing poorly early in his career and wildly later\u2014all of which contributed to his mysterious image. Davis was a complex man with strengths and weaknesses that would ultimately destroy him. Himself the victim of a policeman's clubbing (reportedly, racially inspired), he had the fairness and courage in the late 1950s to challenge black jazzmen's expectations by filling a piano vacancy with a white player, Bill Evans (1929\u20131980); but then, by all accounts, Davis often racially taunted him. A physical fitness enthusiast (with his own private gym), he nevertheless took vast amounts of drugs (sometimes, but not always, for pain). Oftentimes unfriendly, he was also capable of acts of generosity toward struggling musicians, both black and white. Davis was married three times\u2014to dancer Frances Taylor, singer Betty Mabry, and actress Cicely Tyson. All three marriages ended in divorce. He had, in all, three sons, a daughter, and seven grandchildren. He died on September 28, 1991, in Santa Monica, California, of pneumonia, respiratory failure, and a stroke. Davis remains one of the most influential musicians in the history of jazz. His music lives on in recordings like Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1958), and Sketches of Spain (1960), and the hauntingly blue sound of his trumpet.", "context": "Miles davis is influenced by whom? <EOS> Fred griffin <EOS> Who was the supporting artist?"}

She continued her career through the following decades and into the 21st century. Ann-Margret was born Ann-Margret Olsson in Valsj\u00f6byn, J\u00e4mtland County, Sweden, to Anna Regina (Aronsson) and Carl Gustav Olsson, who worked for an electrical company. She came to America at age 6. She studied at Northwestern University and left for Las Vegas to pursue a career as a singer. Ann-Margret was discovered by George Burns and soon afterward got both a record deal at RCA and a film contract at 20th Century Fox. In 1961, her single I Just Don't Understand charted in the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 Charts. Her acting debut followed the same year as Bette Davis' daughter in Frank Capra's Pocketful of Miracles (1961). She appeared in the musical State Fair (1962) a year later before her breakthrough in 1963. With Bye Bye Birdie (1963) and Viva Las Vegas (1964) opposite Elvis Presley, she became a Top 10 Box Office star, teen idol and even Golden Globe nominated actress. She was marketed as Hollywood's hottest young star and in the years to come got awarded the infamous nickname sex kitten. Her following pictures were sometimes ripped apart by critics (Bus Riley's Back in Town (1965) and The Swinger (1966)), sometimes praised (The Cincinnati Kid (1965)). She couldn't escape being typecast because of her great looks. By the late 1960s, her career stalled, and she turned to Italy for new projects. She returned and, by 1970, she was back in the public image with Hollywood films (R.P.M. (1970) opposite Anthony Quinn), Las Vegas sing-and-dance shows and her own television specials. She finally overcame her image with her Oscar-nominated turn in Mike Nichols' Carnal Knowledge (1971) and succeeded in changing her image from sex kitten to respected actress. A near-fatal accident at a Lake Tahoe show in 1972 only momentarily stopped her career. She was again Oscar-nominated in 1975 for Tommy (1975), the rock opera film of the British rock band The Who. Her career continued with successful films throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s. She starred next to Anthony Hopkins in Magic (1978) and appeared in pictures co-starring Walter Matthau, Gene Hackman, Glenda Jackson and Roy Scheider. She even appeared in a television remake of Tennessee Williams's masterpiece play A Streetcar Named Desire in 1983. Another late career highlight for her was Grumpy Old Men (1993) as the object of desire for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.

Indeed, it was Rozelle's reputation for public relations and marketing that created a prime-time venue for the National Football League. The prototypes for Monday Night Football were those annual Monday night games staged from 1966 to 1969 inclusive on CBS. St. Louis hosted three of them, and it seemed natural for the NFL to make Monday night their regular turf. The only trouble was, Rozelle couldn't get a network to agree.#R##N#.#R##N#CBS did not want to lose Gunsmoke. NBC had Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, TV's highest-rated show the past two years. Even ABC, floundering in third place in the ratings, was unsure. Rozelle then threatened to put the Monday night package in syndication via the Hughes Television Service. So ABC bought in. NFL owners themselves weren't keen on Monday Night Football. Some thought the\u00a0gates would be dormant. But then-Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell, who knew a thing or two about marketing himself, agreed to host the first MNF game. He asked that the Browns face the Jets to maximize ABC's first-night audience. The result was a smashing success.#R##N#.#R##N#For 36 years, Monday Night Football would air on ABC. Don Meredith and Howard Cosell were, along with Keith Jackson, part of the original team that started in 1970. After Jackson returned full-time to ABC's college football broadcasts, the network hired Frank Gifford away from CBS. From there, Monday Night Football began its most memorable years. It got ratings thanks to the wide appeal that Cosell, Meredith, and Gifford collectively garnered. Except for a shift in the mid-70s that sent Meredith briefly to another network, ABC played a strong football card for twelve years.#R##N#.#R##N#The separate departures of Meredith and Cosell left the Monday Night Football booth in a shaky transition period during the mid-80s. Though they sometimes got it right on the field, with the high-water mark being Miami's romping of the eventual Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears in 1985, it was plain that the booth could not work with three ex-players (what Howard Cosell had labeled jockocracy). The likes of Fred Williamson, O.J. Simpson, and Joe Namath were quickly disposed. The second-most-stable team was assembled in 1986, when veteran ABC sportscaster Al Michaels joined Gifford. Rounding out the booth was future Hall of Fame offensive lineman Dan Dierdorf. They would share more than a decade of prime time football coverage, including three Super Bowls.#R##N#.#R##N#For all its considerable charm and novelty, one thing Monday Night Football did not achieve was a proper farewell to Frank Gifford. After the 1997 season, the booth welcomed the recently-retired Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason. Gifford was cramped in a studio to introduce pregame and halftime stories for the 1998 season. Neither change worked, as Gifford was out of ABC after one year and Boomer Esiason agreed to a contract settlement in 2000. The next two years were the least successful. Joining Al Michaels was ABC college football analyst Dan Fouts and Dennis Miller. Even though their first season had an abundance of nail-biters (witness the Jets' Midnight Miracle over the Dolphins), the new recruits were unable to get in focus. Miller in particular was over-rehearsed in the hours leading up to a broadcast. Both he and Fouts were out of the booth after January 7, 2002.#R##N#.#R##N#ABC needed a lift for the show, and thought they had it when John Madden (who had recanted on his offer to join ABC in 1994) came over from another network. Monday Night Football went from planes to buses for the next four years. Again, though, the players were meant to be bigger stars than Madden or Michaels. Sometimes it showed, such as the Colts' stunning comeback over the defending World Champion Buccaneers in 2003. But in all honesty, the hundred forces that had emerged after 1970 to compete with Monday Night Football, were collectively getting the better of ABC. Thus, on April 18, 2005, a new eight-year contract sent Monday Night Football to ABC's adopted sister network, ESPN.", "context": "What is spin off for nfl monday night football <EOS> Monday night countdown <EOS> Name the title song"}

He was brought up in a council flat in less than prosperous conditions, the son of deaf and volatile parents in a dysfunctional family setting. He had to learn sign language at an early age. His world did not include television and he had to explain to his father what music sounded like. Despite these obstacles, Griffiths developed a talent for dialects which later allowed him to shine in a number of ethnic portrayals. In films from 1975 on both sides of the Atlantic, his better roles have been in both contemporary and period pieces, such a Gorky Park (1983), Withnail & I (1987), King Ralph (1991), Guarding Tess (1994), Sleepy Hollow (1999) and recently the 'Harry Potter' series as Uncle Vernon Dursley. In a 2007 interview Griffiths declared I like playing Vernon Dursley in Harry Potter because that gives me a licence to be horrible to kids. I hate the odious business of sucking up to the public. In fact, unlike those jovial characters he so often portrayed on screen, Griffiths did not tolerate fools gladly. On occasion, he would get stroppy with members of an audience, notably those failing to switch off their mobile phones during a performance (then again, who could blame him ?). He was also highly thought of as a raconteur and wit. The ever-versatile, often bespectacled and bearded Griffiths did his best work for the small screen, particularly excelling as the inquisitive and resourceful civil servant Henry Jay in Bird of Prey (1982) and as the lovable 'cooking policeman' Henry Crabbe in Pie in the Sky (1994), a role specially created for him. As comic relief he made many a hilarious guest appearance, in, among other popular series, The Vicar of Dibley (1994) (as the Bishop of Mulberry) and as Dr. Bayham Badger in the superb BBC adaption of Bleak House (2005). He could also play evil and sinister, none more so than Swelter in Gormenghast (2000), a character Griffiths described being at once laughably comic and a monster like Idi Amin.

Buckingham started playing music on a toy Mickey Mouse guitar before teaching himself how to play without knowing how to read music. His parents eventually bought him a $35 guitar and his real passion soon began to bloom. Lindsey started singing professionally with his girlfriend at the time, Stevie Nicks. In 1972 the produced several demos and within a year signed a record deal with Polydor Records. They were dropped from the label after their first album Buckingham and Nicks performed poorly. One day, the duo was discovered accidentally by musician Mick Fleetwood at Sound City recording studio. They eventually formed Fleetwood Mac which has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide to date. Lindsey stayed with the band from 1975 to 1987. He then rejoined the band in 1997 and has been with the group ever since. Outside of Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey has released nine solo albums and three DVDs and several live compilation albums of his performances. Lindsey has three children with his wife Kristen Messner.

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as Blowin' in the Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin' became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone, recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Dylan's mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.#R##N##R##N#wikipedia Talk:Bob Dylan/Archive 8 - ... His Turkish ethnicity#R##N##R##N#... This quote comes from Bob Dylan's very own book in 'Chronicles: Volume One'. He says the following: My grandmother's ancestors had been from Constantinople. As a teenager, I used to sing the Ritchie Valens song 'In a Turkish Town' with the lines in it about the 'mystery Turks and the stars above,' and it seemed to suit me more than 'La Bamba.' (pg. 93). You can also find this quote cited in many articles see for example [36] (page 28) and [37] \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.145.8.128 (talk) 11:28, 12 December 2010 (UTC)#R##N##R##N#Recently I found out this, Dylan\u2019s mother was born Beatrice R. Stone in 1915, and had an older brother, Vernon. Two younger siblings followed, Lewis and Irene. All born in the US, they were the children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants Benjamin David Solemovitz (born 1883), who changed Solemovitz to Stone, and his wife Florence Sara nee Edelstein, herself one of ten children.#R##N##R##N#Taking Florence Sara first: the Florence who would become Bob Dylan\u2019s grandmother\u2014she and the other nine Edelstein children were in turn the sons and daughters of Benjamin Harold Edelstein (born 1870) and Lybba nee Jaffe, from Kovno (Kaunas) in Lithuania. (Benjamin Harold\u2019s parents were David and Ida Edelstein; Ida\u2019s parents were Yehuda Aron and Rachel ne\u00b4e Berkovitz. Lybba Jaffe\u2019s parents were Aaron Jaffe and Fannie.)  (from The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia by Michael Gray, pg.641-642).--Sayantan m (talk) 15:11, 12 December 2010 (UTC) #R##N##R##N#Dylan's reference in Chronicles (p. 93) is not to his maternal grandmother but to his father's mother, Anna Zimmerman, n\u00e9e Chana Greenstein. She joined her husband Zigman Zimmerman, emigrating from Odessa (on the Black Sea, in present-day Ukraine) to the US by 1910. The sentence in the article acknowledges Dylan's version in Chronicles: In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kyrgyz and her family originated from Istanbul.#R##N##R##N#One problem is that the information on Anna's death certificate contradicts Dylan's version. The death certificate was signed by her oldest son Maurice (Bob Dylan's uncle), and it states that she was born in Odessa. This is how Michael Gray summarizes it in The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, pp 729-730, under the heading Zimmerman family:#R##N##R##N#Anna, who had also moved to Hibbing, and lived for some years with Bob\u2019s Uncle Maurice, moved into a nursing home way down in St. Paul and died there of arteriosclerosis on April 20, 1955. Her death certificate, with the information supplied by Uncle Maurice, confirmed that she\u2019d been born in Odessa. Dylan contradicts this, writing in Chronicles: Volume One of visiting her when she still lived in Duluth: she \u2018had only one leg and had been a seamstress. \u2026 She\u2019d come to America from Odessa.[but] Originally she\u2019d come from Turkey, sailed from Trabzon, a port town, across the Black Sea. . . . Her family was from Kagizman, a town in Turkey near the Armenian border, and the family name had been Kirghiz. My grandfather\u2019s parents had also come from that area. . . . My grandmother\u2019s ancestors had been from Constantinople.\u2019 #R##N##R##N#I think we should leave the sentence in the article, as it acknowledges Dylan's account of his family history in Chronicles, even though the documents do not confirm his version.

He is acknowledged by many as one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century. Stravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913). The Rite of Spring, which provoked a riot during its premiere, transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His so-called Russian phase was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to neoclassical music. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms (concerto grosso, fugue and symphony). They frequently concealed a vein of intense emotion beneath a surface appearance of detachment or austerity and often paid tribute to the music of earlier masters, for example J.S. Bach and Tchaikovsky. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted serial procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note cells and clarity of form, of instrumentation and of utterance.#R##N##R##N#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky Ruski skladatelj ukrajinskog porijekla kojeg danas mnogi, i na zapadu i u njegovoj rodnoj domovini, smatraju najutjecajnijim skladateljem glazbe XX. stolje\u0107a!#R##N##R##N#http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinski#R##N##R##N#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky#R##N##R##N#http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9,_%D0%98%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8C_%D0%A4%D1%91%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87", "context": "Who are the followers of \u00edgor fi\u00f3dorovich stravinsky? <EOS> David Tanenbaum <EOS> Name a famous quote"}

As a teenager, he often got into trouble with the police and was expelled from school when he was 15. But it was one night that both he and his brother, Liam Gallagher, were at a gig by fellow working class Mancunians The Stone Roses, that he realised that a career in music was possible. In the late 1980s, Noel toured with the Inspiral Carpets as a roadie and guitar technician and, when he heard that their frontman Steve Holt was leaving the band, he auditioned to be their new lead singer, but was turned down. In 1991 Gallagher was asked to join another local band called The Rain, as brother Liam, who was their lead singer, had petitioned the other band members to let him approach his older brother to be their lead guitarist. Liam changed the band's name to Oasis and, after Noel had joined, they were offered a worldwide major label record deal with Sony Music in 1993, which in turn would license their recordings to the indie label Creation Records in the UK. The band went on to have the UK's fastest selling debut album of all-time with their 1994 release, Definitely Maybe, and enjoyed huge amounts of success throughout the mid-1990s as a prominent force in the Britpop movement.

The genre often highlights personal drama and conflict to a much greater extent than other unscripted television such as documentary shows. The genre has various standard tropes, such as reality TV confessionals used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration. In competition-based reality shows, a notable subset, there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode, a panel of judges, and the concept of immunity from elimination. The genre may have begun in earnest in 1991 with the Dutch series Nummer 28, which was the first show to bring together strangers and record their interactions. It then exploded as a phenomenon in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the global success of the series Survivor and Big Brother. These shows and a number of others became global franchises, spawning local versions in dozens of countries.

He quit the band after creative disputes, and started on a solo career both as a performer in albums like Here Come The Warm Jets and a producer and writer.

She was the widow of Ralph De Wilington of Sandhurst, Gloucestershire, who died on 16 Aug. 1382. When her brother John died without issue, Joan became heiress to her younger half-brother, Thomas.

Andrea Bocelli, one of the greatest singing talents in the world today, had poor eyesight since birth and went blind at the age of 12 following a football accident. Andrea started his singing career in the late 1980s, when he became a piano-bar performer throughout Italy. However, he became known to the wider audience after he won the Newcomers section of the Sanremo Music Festival in 1994. Since then, Bocelli has recorded 14 solo studio albums, of both pop and classical music, 3 greatest hits albums, as well as 9 complete operas, selling over 80 million records worldwide. However, it was his participation in Pavarotti's 1992 hit Miserere and Fornaciari's 1993 world tour helped propel him to international attention. Thus, he eventually turned into the most-selling artist in the history of classical music and established himself as one of the most exciting voices in contemporary opera during the late 20th century. He was honored with numerous awards and recognitions for his work, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He is also a great philanthropist and he has participated in charity concerts, such as the Michael Jackson benefit concert in 1998, the Memorial Concert at Ground Zero, in New York City for the victims of the September 11 attacks, and the Music of Asia festival in 2004, for the Indian tsunami appeal.

He prays to have the privilege of purchasing the overplus of 100 acres - as it is improved in various parts. He paying what the same might have been worth in a state of Nature. Henry II is living with his son on an island in the Kennebec River called Weston Island in modern times. Notably, Benedict Arnold and his army were the first non-native squatters on the island; they camped there on their way up the Kennebec River in 1775. A History of the Kennebec Valley states: But to return to Arnold's march up the Kennebec. About the middle of October [1775] the army left Old Point and moved up the valley. As the army passed up the river it rested upon Weston's Island. Arriving at Carratunk Falls, the main army reached the point were they were to leave the Kennebec River and transport their munitions across to Dead River, a distance of about fifteen miles, through a thick forest. Weston's Island was first called McKenney Island. The road the army cleared up the Kennebec River was probably used by Henry to find and settle the island sometime before 1784. Henry II buys an improved 200 acre lot right across the river from his son. Mr. Weston, the surveyor, says: ...This land has had a family thereon till very lately - McKenney purchased it & the family removed & said McKenney now lives with his son on the adjoining island - but expects to remove thereupon in the spring. ... I suspect the family Weston was referring to was in fact Henry II's own children. We know that Charles and William were living close by and signed a petition in 1789.

The original band members were Michael Brown (keyboards), George F Cameron (drums), Tom Finn (bass), Jeff Winfield (guitar) and Steve Martin (vocals). The group's unique sound was distinguished by Martin's expressive soaring vocals and Brown's extremely elegant and melodic orchestral arrangements (complete with lush strings). The Left Banke's music was dubbed baroque pop by the press. The band had a big hit with the touching and beautiful ballad Walk Away Renee, which reached #5 on the Billboard pop charts in late 1966. The equally gorgeous follow-up song Pretty Ballerina likewise did well; it went all the way to #15 on the Billboard pop charts in 1967. Alas, the sumptuous tune Desiree barely cracked the Hot 100 in late 1967. The Left Banke eventually broke up in 1969 due to poor management, financial problems and internal conflicts between the band members. However, the band briefly reunited in the early 70's to record two songs for the soundtrack of the movie Hot Pants Holiday (1971). The single Love Songs in the Night / Two by Two was released by Buddah Records, but unfortunately flopped. The group once again split up. Martin, Cameron, and Finn got together one more time in the late 1970s to record the album Strangers on a Train. This album wound up being shelved for eight years before finally being released in 1986.

The piano lessons were a failure, but she stuck with all the other projects through her graduation from Ramapo Regional High School in Franklin Lakes. She attended Lycoming College and graduated with a major in psychology and a minor in theater. She moved to Maine as a back-to-the-lander in the 70's and lived in a mountain-top house without running water or electricity for seven years.

In 1972 the produced several demos and within a year signed a record deal with Polydor Records. They were dropped from the label after their first album Buckingham and Nicks performed poorly. One day, the duo was discovered accidentally by musician Mick Fleetwood at Sound City recording studio. They eventually formed Fleetwood Mac which has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide to date. Lindsey stayed with the band from 1975 to 1987.

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as Blowin' in the Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin' became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone, recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Dylan's mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.#R##N##R##N#wikipedia Talk:Bob Dylan/Archive 8 - ...

Dylan contradicts this, writing in Chronicles: Volume One of visiting her when she still lived in Duluth: she \u2018had only one leg and had been a seamstress. \u2026 She\u2019d come to America from Odessa.[but] Originally she\u2019d come from Turkey, sailed from Trabzon, a port town, across the Black Sea. . . .

Buckingham started playing music on a toy Mickey Mouse guitar before teaching himself how to play without knowing how to read music. His parents eventually bought him a $35 guitar and his real passion soon began to bloom. Lindsey started singing professionally with his girlfriend at the time, Stevie Nicks. In 1972 the produced several demos and within a year signed a record deal with Polydor Records. They were dropped from the label after their first album Buckingham and Nicks performed poorly. One day, the duo was discovered accidentally by musician Mick Fleetwood at Sound City recording studio. They eventually formed Fleetwood Mac which has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide to date. Lindsey stayed with the band from 1975 to 1987. He then rejoined the band in 1997 and has been with the group ever since. Outside of Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey has released nine solo albums and three DVDs and several live compilation albums of his performances. Lindsey has three children with his wife Kristen Messner.  In January 2018, Lindsey Buckingham listed his 11,000 square foot Los Angeles mansion for $22 million. He bought the property in 2013 for $6 million and proceeded to remodel the Georgian-style, three story mansion.", "entity1": "Mick Fleetwood <S> biology.organism celebrities.celebrity event.agent film.actor internet.social_network_user media_common.cataloged_instance music.composer music.lyricist music.musician music.producer people.person ratings.rated_entity tv.actor tv.personality music.artist award.winner <S> Mick Fleetwood Net Worth: Mick Fleetwood is a British musician who has a net worth of $20 million. Mick Fleetwood's net worth would be much higher but he has openly admitted to spending tens of millions of dollars on drugs and partying during his heyday. He was even forced to declare bankruptcy in 1984 after many years of hard partying and fast living. Michael John Kells Mick Fleetwood was born June 24, 1947 in Redruth, Cornwall, England, U.K. He is widely known as the drummer and co-founder of the rock band Fleetwood Mac. The band name was formulated by merging Mick's last name with part of John McVie's last name. After several album releases and lineup changes, including the addition of keyboardist Christine McVie (who also just so happened to be John McVie's wife), the group moved to the United States in 1974, where Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks soon joined Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham and Nicks contributed to much of Fleetwood Mac's later commercial success. Mick also enjoyed a solo career, published written works and flirted briefly with acting and winemaking. After the supporting tour for 1979's Tusk, Mick recorded his debut solo album, The Visitor, which was released in 1981 and showed off the drummer's interest in worldbeat. After the 1982 Mac album Mirage, he cut a second solo record, 1983's I'm Not Me, which featured cameos from several Mac members. Fleetwood Mac then went on hiatus until 1987, when Mick's declaration of bankruptcy prompted the reunion LP Tango in the Night; even Lindsey Buckingham was persuaded to join in, albeit only in the studio. The band's classic '70s lineup was splintered, but Mick Fleetwood kept versions of the band going throughout the '90s. Meanwhile, he continued working on outside projects, including starting his own record label, TallMan Records. As Fleetwood Mac prepared to tour again in early 2009, the drummer issued yet another album, this one culled from a live performance by the Mick Fleetwood Blues Band entitled Blue Again! with former Fleetwood Mac vocalist Rick Vito assuming front man duties. Fleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.", "context": "Name the artist who is similar to mick fleetwood? <EOS> Lindsey Buckingham <EOS> Mention the name of the parent."}

In 1963, their enormous popularity first emerged as Beatlemania; as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.", "entity1": "bobdylan.com <S> film.music_contributor internet.social_network_user food.diet_follower film.writer film.subject film.editor film.director film.actor event.performer event.agent celebrities.celebrity broadcast.artist book.subject book.author biology.organism award.winner award.nominee award.hall_of_fame_inductee award.competitor media_common.cataloged_instance tv.writer tv.personality tv.crewmember tv.actor symbols.namesake ratings.rated_entity people.person organization.member organization.founder music.songwriter music.producer music.musician music.lyricist music.guitarist music.composer music.artist media_common.subject <S> Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; Hebrew name: Shabtai Zisel; May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter, artist and writer, and Nobel laureate. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as Blowin' in the Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin' became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone, recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Dylan's mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.#R##N##R##N#wikipedia Talk:Bob Dylan/Archive 8 - ... His Turkish ethnicity#R##N##R##N#... This quote comes from Bob Dylan's very own book in 'Chronicles: Volume One'. He says the following: My grandmother's ancestors had been from Constantinople. As a teenager, I used to sing the Ritchie Valens song 'In a Turkish Town' with the lines in it about the 'mystery Turks and the stars above,' and it seemed to suit me more than 'La Bamba.' (pg. 93). You can also find this quote cited in many articles see for example [36] (page 28) and [37] \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.145.8.128 (talk) 11:28, 12 December 2010 (UTC)#R##N##R##N#Recently I found out this, Dylan\u2019s mother was born Beatrice R. Stone in 1915, and had an older brother, Vernon. Two younger siblings followed, Lewis and Irene. All born in the US, they were the children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants Benjamin David Solemovitz (born 1883), who changed Solemovitz to Stone, and his wife Florence Sara nee Edelstein, herself one of ten children.#R##N##R##N#Taking Florence Sara first: the Florence who would become Bob Dylan\u2019s grandmother\u2014she and the other nine Edelstein children were in turn the sons and daughters of Benjamin Harold Edelstein (born 1870) and Lybba nee Jaffe, from Kovno (Kaunas) in Lithuania.

She joined her husband Zigman Zimmerman, emigrating from Odessa (on the Black Sea, in present-day Ukraine) to the US by 1910. The sentence in the article acknowledges Dylan's version in Chronicles: In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kyrgyz and her family originated from Istanbul.#R##N##R##N#One problem is that the information on Anna's death certificate contradicts Dylan's version. The death certificate was signed by her oldest son Maurice (Bob Dylan's uncle), and it states that she was born in Odessa. This is how Michael Gray summarizes it in The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, pp 729-730, under the heading Zimmerman family:#R##N##R##N#Anna, who had also moved to Hibbing, and lived for some years with Bob\u2019s Uncle Maurice, moved into a nursing home way down in St. Paul and died there of arteriosclerosis on April 20, 1955. Her death certificate, with the information supplied by Uncle Maurice, confirmed that she\u2019d been born in Odessa. Dylan contradicts this, writing in Chronicles: Volume One of visiting her when she still lived in Duluth: she \u2018had only one leg and had been a seamstress. \u2026 She\u2019d come to America from Odessa.[but] Originally she\u2019d come from Turkey, sailed from Trabzon, a port town, across the Black Sea. . . .

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as Blowin' in the Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin' became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone, recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Dylan's mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.#R##N##R##N#wikipedia Talk:Bob Dylan/Archive 8 - ... His Turkish ethnicity#R##N##R##N#... This quote comes from Bob Dylan's very own book in 'Chronicles: Volume One'. He says the following: My grandmother's ancestors had been from Constantinople. As a teenager, I used to sing the Ritchie Valens song 'In a Turkish Town' with the lines in it about the 'mystery Turks and the stars above,' and it seemed to suit me more than 'La Bamba.' (pg. 93).

Stone in 1915, and had an older brother, Vernon. Two younger siblings followed, Lewis and Irene. All born in the US, they were the children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants Benjamin David Solemovitz (born 1883), who changed Solemovitz to Stone, and his wife Florence Sara nee Edelstein, herself one of ten children.#R##N##R##N#Taking Florence Sara first: the Florence who would become Bob Dylan\u2019s grandmother\u2014she and the other nine Edelstein children were in turn the sons and daughters of Benjamin Harold Edelstein (born 1870) and Lybba nee Jaffe, from Kovno (Kaunas) in Lithuania.

The sentence in the article acknowledges Dylan's version in Chronicles: In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kyrgyz and her family originated from Istanbul.#R##N##R##N#One problem is that the information on Anna's death certificate contradicts Dylan's version. The death certificate was signed by her oldest son Maurice (Bob Dylan's uncle), and it states that she was born in Odessa.

Her death certificate, with the information supplied by Uncle Maurice, confirmed that she\u2019d been born in Odessa. Dylan contradicts this, writing in Chronicles: Volume One of visiting her when she still lived in Duluth: she \u2018had only one leg and had been a seamstress. \u2026 She\u2019d come to America from Odessa.[but] Originally she\u2019d come from Turkey, sailed from Trabzon, a port town, across the Black Sea. . . .

The enormous household expanded to take in orphaned grandchildren and nurtured originality, ingenuity, and a drive for achievement.#R##N##R##N#The following article relates the death of Henry, Jr.: It is the painful duty of the County Record to chronicle the death of Mr. Henry E. Eaddy, well known as the Sage of Possum Fork. He died at his home near Johnsonville Friday morning about 2:30 o'clock. Mr. Eaddy was a man of rare personality. He was a self made man in every sense of the term. Intellectually he was a genius, being an expert mathemetician. He was a civil engineer by profession, a hospitable Christian gentleman in his home, and a man of charming manner to all who came in contact with him. He was of unusual vitality, both physically and mentally for one of his advanced age, having celebrated his eightieth birthday in March. The evening prior to his death he ate supper and was in his usual happy frame of mind and apparently in good health as he had been for some time and fell asleep. At 2:30 Friday morning he was found dead. Mr. Eaddy was born and reared and spent his long life in the vicinity of Johnsonville. In his young life he married Miss Eliza Louisa Ann Elizabeth Huggins of Timmonsville, a daughter of the late Rev. J.S. Huggins, inventor of the first cotton planter used in the south. He had represented the county of Williamsburg in the State Legislature several terms. He was first elected in 1890. He was one of the original founders of the Old Johnsonville Methodist Church and Trinity Methodist Church in Florence County and supervised the construction of the Old Johnsonville Church. During all of his public life he strove to render his county efficient service. Mr. Eaddy leaves a widow, the former Eliza Huggins, five sons and two daughters: Messrs. J.A. of Bushnell, Fla.; C. L. of Linden, Fla.; John M. of Kingstree; S.O. of Johnsonville; Dr. A. G. of Timmonsville; Mrs. W. A. Hanna of Gifford; and Mrs. R.B. Dickson of Johnsonville. The funeral service, conducted by Rev. E.P. Hutton, took place in Old Johnsonville Methodist Church at 4 p.m. Saturday, and internment was made in the church burying grounds. Six of his grandchildren acted as pallbearers. The funeral exercises were largely attended. #R##N##R##N#Children of Henry Edison, Jr. & Eliza Louise (Huggins) Eaddy: Nettie Adell Eaddy Hanna (1861 - 1941)#R##N##R##N#Find A Grave Memorial # 51540482.", "entity1": "Rosa Belle Eaddy <S> event.agent biology.organism people.deceased_person people.person <S> Spouse: Wattie Gamewell Woodberry (1863 - April 30, 1900).

He quit the band after creative disputes, and started on a solo career both as a performer in albums like Here Come The Warm Jets and a producer and writer.

Thegan's Vita Hludowici Imperatoris names (in order) Hlutharius, Pippinus, Hludowicus sons of Emperor Louis I & his wife Ermengard[8]. His father sent him to govern Bavaria in [Aug] 814[9]. He was crowned joint Emperor LOTHAIRE I in Jul 817 at Aachen, ruling jointly with his father. He was sent to Italy in 822, where he established his court at Pavia and was crowned King of Italy by the Archbishop of Milan. The Annales Xantenses record that Ludewicus imperator gave filio suo Lothario regnum Langobardorum in 822[10]. Einhard's Annales record that the emperor sent Walahum monachum propinquum suum [imperatoris] fratrem\u2026Adalhardi abbatis to Italy in 822 with Hlotharius\u2026filium suum[11]. He was again crowned Emperor, at Rome 5 Apr 823 by Pope Pascal I. The rivalry with his father and brothers was exacerbated by the unexpected birth of his half-brother Charles in 823. Tension was increased when Emperor Louis invested Charles with Alemannia, Rhetia, Alsace and part of Burgundy at Worms in Aug 829, reducing Lothaire's territory to Italy. Lothaire and his brothers rebelled in Mar 830, captured their father at Compi\u00e8gne, and forced him to revert to the constitutional arrangements decided in 817. However, Emperor Louis reasserted his authority at the assemblies of Nijmegen in Oct 830 and Aix-la-Chapelle in Feb 831, and deprived Lothaire of the imperial title and relegated him once more to Italy. A further revolt of the brothers followed. Emperor Louis was defeated and deposed by his sons at Compi\u00e8gne 1 Oct 833. He was exiled to the monastery of Saint-M\u00e9dard de Soissons. Lothaire declared himself sole emperor 30 Jun 833, but was forced to flee to Vienne by his brothers Pepin and Louis, who freed their father. Emperor Louis was restored 1 Mar 834, crowned once more at Metz 28 Feb 835. Lothaire captured Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, but was arrested by his father's troops near Chouzy. His father pardoned him and sent him back to Italy as king. Emperor Louis proposed yet another partition in favour of his son Charles at the assembly of Aachen in 837, which was implemented at the assembly of Worms 28 May 839 when he installed his sons Lothaire and Charles jointly, the former taking all land east of the River Meuse, the latter everything to the west, and set aside the claims of his son Louis and the successors of his late son Pepin. Lothaire succeeded as sole emperor on his father\u2019s death 20 Jun 840. He sought to extend his power base northwards from Italy across the Alps, and deprive his half-brother Charles. The latter allied himself with his half-brother Louis, and together they defeated Lothaire at Fontenoy-en-Puisaye, near Auxerre 25 Jun 841. After retreating to Aachen, Lothaire was forced out to Lyon in Apr 842 by his brothers, who declared him incapable of governing the empire. Preliminary peace proposals signed on an island in the Sa\u00f4ne, near M\u00e2con 15 Jun 842 led to the Treaty of Verdun 11 Aug 843, under which the territory of the empire was divided between the three brothers. Lothaire retained the imperial title and was also installed as LOTHAIRE I King of Lotharingia, a newly created territory covering a wide strip of land from the North Sea coast southwards to Italy, the new country being named after him. He established his seat of government at Aachen, and installed his son Louis as King of Italy. Over the following ten years, a series of meetings aimed to maintain peace between the three brothers, with varying success. After a serious illness, Emperor Lothaire abdicated in Sep 855 at Kloster Sch\u00fcller, near Pr\u00fcm, and divided his territories between his sons Louis II, Lothaire II and Charles. The Annales Bertiniani record that Emperor Lothaire entered monasterium Prone\u00e6 in Arduenna, was tonsured, died IV Kal Oct and was buried in the monastery[12]. The necrology of Pr\u00fcm records the death 855 III Kal Oct of Lotharius imperator[13]. #R##N##R##N#m (Thionville, Moselle mid-Oct 821) ERMENGARDE, daughter of HUGUES Comte [de Tours] [Etichonen] & his wife Ava --- (-20 Mar 851, bur Kloster Erstein, near Strasbourg). Thegan's Vita Hludowici Imperatoris refers to the wife of Emperor Lothaire as filiam Hugi comitis, qui erat de stirpe cuiusdam ducis nomine Etih and in the following paragraph names her Irmingarda[14]. The Annales Xantenses record the marriage in 821 of Ludewicus imperator\u2026filio suo Lothario and Ermingardam filiam Hugonis comitis Turonicorum[15]. She founded Kloster Erstein in Alsace in 849. The Annales Xantenses record the death in 851 of imperatrix\u2026Irmingard, coniunx Lotharii imperatoris[16].

He was crowned joint Emperor LOUIS II, reigning jointly with his father, at Rome in Apr 850 by Pope Leo IV. He was sole emperor in 855 after the death of his father. - KINGS of ITALY. #R##N##R##N#2.

BERTA ([830]-after 7 May 852, maybe after [877]). A letter from Hincmar Archbishop of Reims to Irmingardi august\u00e6, included by Flodoard in the Historia Remensis Ecclesi\u00e6, names Bert\u00e6, ipsius imperatricis fili\u00e6 referring to her activities at Avennaci monasterii, a later passage confirming that she was abbatiss\u00e6 Avennaci monasterii[26]. A poem by Sedulius is addressed to Berta\u2026proles\u2026Lothari\u2026Ermingardis matris[27]. Abbess of Avenay before 847. Maybe Abbess of Faremoutiers 852-after 877. m ([Worms autumn 841]) ---. Berta was married, as shown by a second poem by Sedulius addressed to Berta which names Ermingardis C\u00e6sareumque as her mother and refers to Bertha's earthly spouse\u2026now in heaven[28]. It is possible that she was the daughter Hlotharius\u2026fili\u00e6 su\u00e6 whose marriage is referred to at Worms in Autumn 841 in the Annals of Fulda [29]. Berta's husband has not been identified. #R##N##R##N#5. GISELA ([830]-860). The necrology of Brixen records that Domnus Imperator Lotharius tradidit filiam suam domnam Gislam[30].

LOTHAIRE ([835]-Piacenza 8 Aug 869, bur Convent of San Antonio near Piacenza). Regino names Hludowicum, Hlotharium et Carolum as the three sons of Emperor Lothaire & his wife[32]. Lothario rege is named filio imperatoris Lotharii by Folcuin[33]. The Annales Bertiniani record that Emperor Lothaire gave Frisia to his son Lothaire in 855[34]. He succeeded his father in 855 as LOTHAIRE II King of Lotharingia, with Aachen as his capital. He attempted to annul his marriage to marry his mistress of many years, but was opposed by Hincmar Archbishop of Reims, and later Pope Nicholas I who ordered him to return to his wife 15 Aug 865. He was negotiating with Pope Hadrian II for a new decision when he died of malaria[35]. On his death, his lands were divided between Ludwig II der Deutsche King of the East Franks and Charles II le Chauve King of the West Franks, instead of passing to his brother Emperor Louis despite the latter's objections. The necrology of Pr\u00fcm records the death 869 Kal Iul of Lotharius rex filius eius [=Lotharius imperator][36]. m ([855], separated 857, repudiated 860) TEUTBERGA, daughter of BOSO l'Ancien Comte d\u2019Arles & his wife --- (-Metz before 25 Nov 875, bur Metz, Abbaye de Sainte-Glossinde). The Annales Lobienses name Tietberga, sorore Hucberti abbatis as lawful wife of Lotharius[37]. The Annales Bertiniani name Teutbergam as materteram suam [=Bosone filio Buvini comitis][38]. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names Thieberga regina legitima uxore [Lotharii], specifying that she relied on the advice of Bosonis comitis at the time of her repudiation, although her relationship to him is not specified[39]. Herimannus names Tiohtpirga uxore legitima of King Lothaire II when recording his repudiation of her[40]. She protected the wife of Boso Count in Italy after she deserted her husband. She was repudiated on the grounds of her alleged incest with her brother Hugobert[41]. Her husband kept her prisoner after separating from her. The Annales Bertiniani record that uxor Lotharii fled to fratrem suum Hucbertum in regno Karli in 860[42]. She escaped in 860 and sought refuge with Charles II le Chauve who gave her the abbey of Avenay in the diocese of Reims. The Annales Bertiniani records that uxore [Lothario] gave support to uxori Bosonis et Balduino qui filiam eius [=Karoli regis] furatus fuerat in uxorem[43]. Abbess of Sainte Glossinde at Metz 869. Heccardus comes names \u2026Teutbergane uxore Lotharii\u2026 among the beneficiaries under his testamentary disposition dated to [Jan 876][44]. It is not certain that this refers to the separated wife of King Lothar II, but no other Teutberga/Lothaire couple has been identified at the time. If this identification is correct, it suggests a family relationship between Teutberga and Ecchard, which has not yet been identified. Mistress (1): (from [855]) WALDRADA, daughter of --- (-9 Apr after 868). One manuscript of the Gesta Treverorum names Waldradam sororem\u2026Guntheri Coloniensis archiepiscopus when recording her adulterous relationship with King Lothaire II[45]. The C\u00e6sarii Heisterbacensis Catalogus of archbishops of K\u00f6ln records that the concubine of Lotharius was Waldradam, sororem Guntheri archiepiscopi Coloniensis and that her brother encouraged Lothaire to leave his legitimate wife for Waldrada, for which he was excommunicated by the Pope[46]. The Annales Novesienses record that \u201cGuntherus episcopus Coloniensis\u201d had \u201csororem\u2026Vastradam\u2026aliis Waldradam\u201d whom \u201cdux Lotharingi\u00e6 Lotharius\u2026superdixit\u201d after her brother approved his divorce from \u201clegitima uxore Tyberga\u201d[47]. According to Baron Ernouf[48], Gunther archbishop of K\u00f6ln was uncle of Waldrada and Thetgaud archbishop of Trier was her brother, but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. The Annales Bertiniani names Hlotharius Waldradam concubinam when recording that Lothaire purported to marry her in 862 and crowned her with the support of Liutfrido avunculo suo et Waltario[49]. Waldrada was also related to the Etichonen Grafen im Nordgau (ALSACE), as shown by the Vita Sancti Deicoli which names Waldrada\u2026Heberardo comitis consanguinitatis[50], but the precise relationship is not known. Folcuin records King Lothaire's excommunication after repudiating his wife for Waldrada[51]. King Lothaire purported to marry Waldrada in [Aug/Sep] 862 and crowned her as Queen, but this was not recognised by the church[52]. She became a nun at Remiremont. King Lothaire II had four illegitimate children by Mistress (1):#R##N##R##N#a) HUGUES ([855/60]-after 895). Duke of Alsace 867, until after Aug 869. The Annales Bertiniani record that King Lothaire invested filioque suo de Waldrada Hugoni with ducatum Elisatium in 867[53]. Herimannus names Hugonem, Lotharii regis ex Waldrada filium when recording his rebellion in 879[54]. After his father's death, Charles II le Chauve King of the West Franks invaded Alsace and Hugues was obliged to submit to him. The Gesta Francorum records that Hugo, Hlutharii et Waldrada filius caused tyranny in France in 879[55]. Pope John VIII excommunicated Hugonem Lotharii Regis quondam filium non legitimum in 878[56]. Hugues challenged Louis II le B\u00e8gue and his son Louis III le Jeune in Lotharingia in 879, but was defeated in 880 and swore allegiance at Gondreville in May 881 to Louis le Jeune who gave him the abbey of Lobbes. The Annales Fuldenses record that Ludwig II der Deutsche King of the East Franks sent legatis nepotum suorum to fight Hugonem tyrannidem exercentem in Gallia in 880[57]. Charles III le Gros King of the East Franks gave him domains of the bishopric of Metz in 882, but Hugues rebelled in the same year, was defeated once more and took refuge in Burgundy. He rebelled again in 885 and sought support from his brother-in-law Gotfrid in Frisia[58]. The Annales Vedastini record that Hugo\u2026filius Hlotharii regis was blinded in 885 on the advice of Heinrico duce[59]. He was shut in the monastery of Fulda, later transferred to Sankt-Gallen, and finally to the abbey of Pr\u00fcm[60]. m (883) as her fourth husband, FRIDERADA, widow firstly of ENGUERRAND, secondly of BERNARIUS, and thirdly of WICBERT, daughter of ---. Regino names Friderada as wife of Engilrammo ex qua filiam quam postmodem Richwinus comes in coniugem accepti, also referring to her subsequent marriages[61]. The Chronico Saxonico records that Hugo filius Lotharii Regis had Wicbertum comitem murdered and married his wife Frideradam in 883[62]. b) GISELA ([860/65]-[21 May/26 Oct] 907). Regino records the marriage in 882 of Gisla filia Hlotharii and rex Godofridus Nordmannorum[63]. The Annales Fuldenses record the marriage of Gotafrid Nordmannus qui superiore anno fuerat baptizatus and Hugone Hlutharii filio eiusque sororem in 883[64]. Abbess at Nivelles and Fosses, after her husband died.

He was one of the leaders of the Danes who ravaged large parts of territory between the Rhine and the Somme. He converted to Christianity, and Emperor Charles le Gros granted him large parts of Frisia as dux. c) BERTA ([863]-8 Mar 925, bur Lucca, Santa Maria). Hugo comes et marchio names patris mei Teutbaldi et matris me\u00e6 Berthe\u2026 in a donation by charter dated 924[67]. Berte is also named as mother of Hugo rex in the latter's donation to Cluny for the souls of his parents dated 8 Mar 934[68]. Her parentage and first marriage are confirmed by the Annales Bertiniani which name Hugonem Lotharii iunioris filium and \u201csororium illius Theutbaldum\u201d in 880[69]. Her origin and second marriage are confirmed by the epitaph of Comitiss\u00e6\u2026Bertha specifies that she was uxor Adalberti Ducis Itali\u00e6\u2026regalis generi\u2026filia Lotharii and records her death in 925[70]. Liudprand provides the proof that Berta, who married Marchese Adalberto, was the widow of Theotbald when he names Berta matre regis Hugonis, specifying that she was previously married to Adalberto, when recording her death[71]. She was regent of Tuscany after the death of her second husband in 915. m firstly ([879/80]) THEOTBALD [Thibaut] Comte d\u2019Arles, son of HUBERT d'Arles, Comte de Transjuranie & his wife --- (-[Jun 887]/[895]). m secondly ([895/98]) ADALBERTO II Marchese of Tuscany, Conte e Duca di Lucca, son of ADALBERT I Marchese of Tuscany & his wife Rothildis of Spoleto (-[10/19] Sep 915, bur Lucca Cathedral). d) ERMENGARDE (-6 Aug after [895/898], bur Lucca, Santa Giustina). Her epitaph at Lucca records the death VIII Id Aug of Ermingardis\u2026dicata deo as daughter of rex\u2026Lotharius[72]. Nun at Santa Giustina in Lucca. Gingins-la-Sarra suggests that Ermengarde was the wife of Berlion [I] Vicomte de Vienne, suggesting that she went to Provence with her sister Berta who married Thibaut Comte d\u00b4Arles[73]. He says that the charter dated 25 Dec 923, under which \u201cLudwicus\u2026imperator augustus\u201d confirmed property \u201cin comitatu Viennensi seu et in Lugdunensi in villa\u2026Tadernaco\u201d to \u201cIngelbertus\u2026et uxori eius Nonie\u201d (Engelbert being this couple\u00b4s son)[74], refers to Engelbert as \u201cpropinquus\u201d of the emperor. He says that the term was never used in charters which name Berlion [I] and therefore deduces that the relationship must have been through Engelbert\u00b4s mother. However, the text of the charter in question does not appear to apply the word \u201cpropinquus\u201d specifically to Engelbert. It is used in the phrase \u201cpropinquorum et fidelium suorum\u201d, as part of the introductory words in the charter, while Engelbert is named in the document as \u201cfidelis noster\u201d. There appears to be no other basis for this speculation. If the hypothesis were correct, it would be difficult to explain why Ermengarde would have left Provence (presumably after the death of her supposed husband, dated to [912]) and established herself as a nun at Lucca, while her two sons remained in Provence. #R##N##R##N#7.

The name Reginar or Reginhar (French: R\u00e9gnier or Rainier) was commonplace in his family.#R##N##R##N#Reginar was originally a supporter of Zwentibold in 895, but he broke with the king in 898. He and some other magnates who had been key to Zwentibold's election three years earlier then took the opportunity provided by the death of Odo of West Francia to invite Charles the Simple to become king in Lotharingia. His lands were confiscated, but he refused to give them up and entrenched himself at Durfost, downstream from Maastricht.

He led the magnates in opposing Conrad I of Germany and electing Charles the Simple their king. He was given the title marchio by Charles in 915. He never appears as the Duke of Lorraine, but he was definitely the military commander of the region under Charles.

The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. The Annales Hanoni\u00e6 name Manicherius filius [Albonis] (in a later passage clarified to be Manicerius Registensis dominus) as pater aut avunculus primi Ragineri and Raginerus dictus Longi-colli filius eius[6], which, as explained in the Introduction, must be incorrect. The Annales Hanoni\u00e6 name Rignerius Montensis comes as the ally of Francone episcopo Leodiensi against the Vikings in 870, and in a later undated passage Raginerus fighting cum Frissonibus in Walacria contra Rollonem[7], although it is unclear from the context whether these references are to Raginerus dictus Longi-colli. Guillaume de Jumi\u00e8ges describes how Rainier au long cou duc de Hasbaigne et du Hainaut et Radbold prince de Frise fought the Viking Rollo but were forced back to their castles[8]. The date when Reginar was installed as Comte de Hainaut is uncertain but was probably during the last quarter of the 9th century. An agreement dated 14 Jun 877 of Emperor Charles II le Chauve, presumably written with his own death in mind, names Arnulfus comes, Gislebertus, Letardus, Matfridus, Widricus, Gotbertus, Adalbertus, Ingelgerus, Rainerus as those willing to support the emperor's son if he travels across the Meuse[9], although it is curious that Giselbertus\u2026Rainerus should both be included if one was the father of the other. Ragenarius comes\u2026et coniuge mea Hersenda confirmed the donation of revenue from Sathanacense atque Mousense to Saint-Dagobert de Stenay made by Carolus\u2026Augustus Imperiali by charter dated to after 886[10]. The Annales Vedastini name Balduinus\u2026comes et Rodulfus frater eius necnon et Ragnerus when recording that they joined Zwentibold of Lotharingia in 895[11]. The Breve Chronicon Epternacense names \u201cReinerus\u201d as abbot of Echternach from 897 to 915[12]. Regino records that in 898 Zwentibold King of Lotharingia banished Reginarium ducem\u2026sibi fidissimum et unicum consiliarium who went with Odacro comite et quibusdam aliis, cum mulieribus et parvulis to Durfos (near Mosa fluvius) where they were besieged[13]. The passage appears to be the only indication that Reginar was granted the title duke. Reginar was presumably rehabilitated after King Zweintibold was murdered, as shown by the following charter. Ludwig IV das Kind King of Germany confirmed an exchange of property between Kloster Stablo and Reginarius comes by charter dated 10 Sep 902[14]. King Ludwig IV also confirmed an exchange of property involving Reganarius comes by charter dated 20 Oct 906[15], and a donation of property \u2026in pago ac in comitatu Hainuense to the church of Tongern at the request of Kepehardus et Reginharius comites by charter dated 18 Jan 908[16]. Raginarius comes and the abbot of Stavelot granted property in pago Hasbanio in locis Honavi, Versines et Serangio to quidam fidelium nostrorum Harduinus by charter dated 911, signed by Ragenarii comitis, Issaac comitis, Macineri comitis\u2026[17]. Reginar was installed as marchio by Charles III le Simple King of the West Franks in 915. Lay-abbot of St Servatius at Maastricht before May 898, and of Stablo and Malm\u00e9dy 900-902.

The estimated birth date of her son Giselbert suggests that Alberada may have been her husband\u00b4s second wife, assuming that the charter which names his other wife Hersenda can be dated to soon after 886 (see above). Another possibility is that both documents refer to the same person, one or other having incorrectly represented her name. Maybe heiress of Hainaut[21].

His legend continued to grow even after poor health and diminished creativity removed him from jazz royalty. Early life Miles Dewey Davis III was born to Miles Davis Jr. and Cleota Henry in Alton, Illinois, on May 25, 1926. There were also two other children, an older sister and a younger brother. In 1928 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis's father became a successful oral surgeon. Davis enjoyed a comfortable childhood and the family lived in a white neighborhood. At the age of thirteen his father gave him a trumpet and soon Davis joined his high school band. While still in high school he met and was coached by his earliest idol, the great St. Louis trumpeter Clark Terry (1920\u2013). After fathering two children by a woman friend, Davis moved to New York City in 1944. He worked for just two weeks in the talent-packed Billy Eckstine Band, then enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music. By day he studied classical music, and by night he gained experience in jazz's newest movement, bebop, with the leaders of the movement, notably Charlie Parker (1920\u20131955), Dizzy Gillespie (1917\u20131993), Fats Navarro, and Max Roach (1924\u2013).  Cool jazz Davis's stint from 1947 to 1948 in a quintet (group of five musicians) led by bebop genius Charlie Parker brought him early fame. A fine bebop trumpeter, Davis soon felt a need to rid his music of bebop's style and to restore jazz's more melodic elements. The result was the influential recording Birth of the Cool (1949), which gave birth to the so-called cool, or West Coast, jazz school. This recording established Davis' musical identity, separate from Parker and the other beboppers. In the early 1950s Davis became a heroin (dangerous drug made from morphine) addict. His career came to a near halt for three years, but his ultimately successful fight against the drug habit in 1954 led to his greatest period: the mid-to-late 1950s. During that six-year span he made a series of small group recordings regarded as jazz classics. In 1954, with tenor saxophone titan Sonny Rollins (1930\u2013), he made memorable recordings of three Rollins originals\u2014Airegin, Doxy, and Oleo\u2014as well as two brilliant versions of the Tin Pan Alley (a respected group of musicians and songwriters) standard But Not for Me. In 1955 Davis formed his most celebrated group, a remarkably talented quintet that featured tenor saxophonist John Coltrane (1926\u20131967), pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. Until Coltrane left in the 1960s, Davis's band was the single most visible and dominant group in all of jazz. In 1964 he put together a new band, and Davis continued to be the greatest attraction (and biggest money-maker) in all of jazz. His new band, however, could not match the impossibly high standards of the original band. Davis, the person For the last two decades of Davis's career he became more of a jazz curiosity than a musician to be taken seriously. A good part of his fame owed less to his considerable musicianship than to his strange personality.

His legend continued to grow even after poor health and diminished creativity removed him from jazz royalty. Early life Miles Dewey Davis III was born to Miles Davis Jr. and Cleota Henry in Alton, Illinois, on May 25, 1926. There were also two other children, an older sister and a younger brother. In 1928 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis's father became a successful oral surgeon. Davis enjoyed a comfortable childhood and the family lived in a white neighborhood. At the age of thirteen his father gave him a trumpet and soon Davis joined his high school band. While still in high school he met and was coached by his earliest idol, the great St. Louis trumpeter Clark Terry (1920\u2013). After fathering two children by a woman friend, Davis moved to New York City in 1944. He worked for just two weeks in the talent-packed Billy Eckstine Band, then enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music. By day he studied classical music, and by night he gained experience in jazz's newest movement, bebop, with the leaders of the movement, notably Charlie Parker (1920\u20131955), Dizzy Gillespie (1917\u20131993), Fats Navarro, and Max Roach (1924\u2013).  Cool jazz Davis's stint from 1947 to 1948 in a quintet (group of five musicians) led by bebop genius Charlie Parker brought him early fame. A fine bebop trumpeter, Davis soon felt a need to rid his music of bebop's style and to restore jazz's more melodic elements. The result was the influential recording Birth of the Cool (1949), which gave birth to the so-called cool, or West Coast, jazz school. This recording established Davis' musical identity, separate from Parker and the other beboppers. In the early 1950s Davis became a heroin (dangerous drug made from morphine) addict. His career came to a near halt for three years, but his ultimately successful fight against the drug habit in 1954 led to his greatest period: the mid-to-late 1950s. During that six-year span he made a series of small group recordings regarded as jazz classics. In 1954, with tenor saxophone titan Sonny Rollins (1930\u2013), he made memorable recordings of three Rollins originals\u2014Airegin, Doxy, and Oleo\u2014as well as two brilliant versions of the Tin Pan Alley (a respected group of musicians and songwriters) standard But Not for Me. In 1955 Davis formed his most celebrated group, a remarkably talented quintet that featured tenor saxophonist John Coltrane (1926\u20131967), pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. Until Coltrane left in the 1960s, Davis's band was the single most visible and dominant group in all of jazz. In 1964 he put together a new band, and Davis continued to be the greatest attraction (and biggest money-maker) in all of jazz. His new band, however, could not match the impossibly high standards of the original band. Davis, the person For the last two decades of Davis's career he became more of a jazz curiosity than a musician to be taken seriously. A good part of his fame owed less to his considerable musicianship than to his strange personality. Davis gained a poor reputation in performance for turning his back on audiences, for expressing racial hostility toward whites, for dressing poorly early in his career and wildly later\u2014all of which contributed to his mysterious image. Davis was a complex man with strengths and weaknesses that would ultimately destroy him. Himself the victim of a policeman's clubbing (reportedly, racially inspired), he had the fairness and courage in the late 1950s to challenge black jazzmen's expectations by filling a piano vacancy with a white player, Bill Evans (1929\u20131980); but then, by all accounts, Davis often racially taunted him. A physical fitness enthusiast (with his own private gym), he nevertheless took vast amounts of drugs (sometimes, but not always, for pain). Oftentimes unfriendly, he was also capable of acts of generosity toward struggling musicians, both black and white. Davis was married three times\u2014to dancer Frances Taylor, singer Betty Mabry, and actress Cicely Tyson. All three marriages ended in divorce. He had, in all, three sons, a daughter, and seven grandchildren. He died on September 28, 1991, in Santa Monica, California, of pneumonia, respiratory failure, and a stroke.

David Bowie made popular music for nearly 50 years. He was known for writing innovative, experimental work that was also commercially and critically successful. He is considered one of the most influential rock artists of all time and has had 9 platinum albums in the UK and 5 in the US. He was born David Robert Jones on January 8, 1947, in London, England. He developed an early interest in music and was already playing the saxophone at the age of 13. He soon started a career as a commercial artist, singing and playing with rock bands in his spare time. By 1966 he recorded several singles with three different groups. He eventually set out on his own, first catching the eye and ear of the public in July 1969 with his song Space Oddity. The single became so popular that it reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. The same year, he formed his own mime troupe, Feathers, as well as an experimental art ensemble. This was the time when he adopted the stage name, David Bowie, mainly to avoid confusion with Davy Jones (of pop group The Monkees). Not being as commercially successful as he expected, Bowie inked a deal to record an album, which included the offbeat 'Space Oddity'. Bowie's next effort, 1970s The Man Who Sold the World, was a move toward a harder rock sound. Two years later, he finally made his big breakthrough with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars, a concept album about a sexually ambiguous rock star from outer space. Bowie, who was famous for his campy cross-dressing and different colored eyes, achieved his first major American crossover success in 1976 with the number-one single Fame and the hit album Young Americans. The same year, he also appeared on the big screen in the feature The Man Who Fell to Earth, a film that was a modest box-office success. Next, he teamed up with musician Brian Eno to work on albums called Berlin Trilogy, all reaching the UK top five and receiving lasting critical praise. He truly won the world with subsequent hit singles like Ashes to Ashes (1980), Under Pressure (a 1981 collaboration with Queen) and the several hits spawned by the 1983 album Let's Dance. In the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, his latest studio album The Next Day being released in March 2013. Thanks to his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and eclecticism of his work, he will be best remembered as a major figure in the world of popular music. Unfortunately, David Bowie died on on January 10, 2016 at the age of 69 after an 18 month battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife, the supermodel Iman, who he married in 1992. He also is survived by his son from his first wife, film director Duncan Jones and a daughter Alexandria Zahra Jones who was born in 2000.", "context": "Who is reponsible for influencing vortigern, king of the britons? <EOS> The all golden <EOS> Who was the supporting artist who performed with the person?"}

Here is an extraordinary portrait of one of the most complicated and misunderstood figures among the Founding Fathers. In 1804, while serving as vice president, Aaron Burr fought a duel with his political nemesis, Alexander Hamilton, and killed him. In 1807, he was arrested, tried, and acquitted of treason. In 1833, Burr is newly married, an aging statesman considered a monster by many. But he is determined to tell his own story, and he chooses to confide in a young New York City journalist named Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler. Together, they explore both Burr's past and the continuing civic drama of their young nation.  Burr is the first novel in Gore Vidal's Narratives of Empire series, which spans the history of the United States from the Revolution to post-World War II.

In 2009, Guinness World Records cited her as the most awarded female act of all time. Houston is one of pop music's best-selling music artists of all-time, with an estimated 170\u2013200 million records sold worldwide. She released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification. Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her prominence on MTV, starting with her video for How Will I Know, influenced several African American women artists who follow in her footsteps.#R##N##R##N#Wikipedia: Whitney Houston#R##N##R##N##R##N#All My Love For You#R##N##R##N#Thanks to hit singles like Saving All My Love For You and I Wanna Dance With Somebody, Whitney Houston became one of the biggest female pop music stars of the 1980s and 1990s. Her first four albums, released between 1985 and 1992, amassed global sales in excess of 86 million copies. #R##N##R##N#She was born on August 9, 1963 in Newark, New Jersey to John and Emily \u201cCissy\u201d Houston (n\u00e9e Drinkard). Her father was an Army serviceman and her mother's vocal group, the Sweet Inspirations, sang backup for Aretha Franklin. #R##N##R##N#Houston began singing in church as a child. While still in high school, she sang backup for Chaka Khan and Lou Rawls and modeled for fashion magazines. At age 19 she signed with Arista Records, whose president, Clive Davis, groomed the gospel-based singer for crossover pop success. Her debut album, Whitney Houston (1985), yielded three number one singles: \u201cGreatest Love of All,\u201d which became her signature; \u201cSaving All My Love for You\u201d; and \u201cHow Will I Know.\u201d Whitney (1987) delivered four more number ones and earned Houston her first Grammy Award (for the single \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody\u201d). In 1992 she married singer Bobby Brown (divorced 2007) and made her motion-picture debut in The Bodyguard; the film featured her rendition of Dolly Parton's \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d which stayed at number one for 14 weeks. The film sound track dominated the Grammys the following year, and Houston won the awards for album of the year, record of the year, and best female pop vocal performance. In the mid-1990s she continued acting, in films such as Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher's Wife (1996), and the sound track of each film generated hit singles for her.#R##N##R##N#In 1998 Houston released My Love Is Your Love, which did not sell as well as previous efforts but was praised by the critics and earned her another Grammy Award. In 2000 she signed a new multi-album contract with Arista for $100 million, but personal difficulties soon overshadowed her recording career. Houston's relationship with Brown provided fodder for the tabloids, as did her health and financial issues. Her 2002 album, Just Whitney, was a personal response to her detractors, but its sales were disappointing compared with earlier efforts. Other than a lackluster holiday album, One Wish (2003), Houston spent subsequent years in a state of virtual retirement.#R##N##R##N#In February 2009 she began a comeback effort with a four-song set at Clive Davis's pre-Grammy Awards gala. The performance was greeted warmly, and in June Houston announced that an album of new material would be available later that year. I Look to You was released in August to positive reviews, and standout songs included the up-tempo \u201cMillion Dollar Bill\u201d (penned by Alicia Keys) and the title track, a slow-building ballad written by R. Kelly.#R##N##R##N#Sources: Wikipedia, Biography, Who2#R##N##R##N#See also#R##N##R##N#R.I.P.

Over 35 years, Takashima has led his teams to Koshien a record 21 times, and won 3 National titles. Through extensive interviews we reveal the mindset of the man many Japanese consider a living Samurai. His training regimen focuses not on technique, but rather on developing fighting spirit . In blistering heat or driving rain, the team trains at least 8 hours a day, 360 days a year. At Chiben, two young recruits, Maeda and Hashimoto, explain their lives as aspiring professional players. They have chosen to put aside their education and their families in pursuit of their baseball dreams. But they can't go pro unless they make it to Koshien. The Chiben Cheer Squad is also legendary throughout Japan, and their senior leader, Furukawa, explains why they too must train so hard. Whenever Chiben plays a game, they bring the cheer squad, the brass band, cheerleaders, and the entire school (one thousand strong). Chiben enters the Wakayama tournament as defending champions and coasts through their first few games. But in the world of high school baseball, there are no sure things. Tennoji is one of the top public schools in Osaka, and students must pass a rigorous exam to get in. Their baseball coach, Masa-sensei, explains how high school baseball will train his students' hearts for life outside baseball. All the same, everybody dreams of Koshien. With such an intense focus on academics, baseball is squeezed into the early morning or late afternoon. They do not have the funding or the scholarships to recruit players, so their chances of making it to Koshien are microscopic. They have not made it to Koshien since 1949. Nevertheless, they practice year-round, six days a week -- before and after school hours -- as well as during vacations, with financial support from their alumni. Senior third baseman Daisuke wakes up at 4 a.m. to travel to morning practice, with lunch from his mom and a ride to the station from dad. Maeda, the team's senior captain, faces great pressure not only as leader, but also as the team's best hitter and ace pitcher. Maeda's father skips work to see his games.

His parents eventually bought him a $35 guitar and his real passion soon began to bloom. Lindsey started singing professionally with his girlfriend at the time, Stevie Nicks. In 1972 the produced several demos and within a year signed a record deal with Polydor Records. They were dropped from the label after their first album Buckingham and Nicks performed poorly.

Born into a musical family, McVie's father, Cyril Perfect, was an accomplished violinist and music lecturer at St Peter's College of Education, Saltley. He remained active in the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra into his mid-eighties. Her mother Beatrice (Tee, n\u00e9e Reece) was a medium, psychic and faith healer. McVie's grandfather was an organist at Westminster Abbey. Introduced to the piano at the age of four, McVie did not study music until age 11, continuing her classical training until age 15. She then shifted her musical focus to Rock and Roll. It is said that she became addicted to Rock and Roll from the very first time she looked through a Fats Domino songbook. While studying sculpture at Birmingham Art College, she got caught in the throes of the blues revival that was sweeping England. She made some duo appearances with Spencer Davis (before he teamed with Steve Winwood and Muff Windwood for the ignition of the Spencer Davis Group). Christine then met Stan Webb and Andy Silvester and joined them in the band, Sounds of Blue. By the time McVie graduated from college with a teaching degree, Sounds of Blue dismembered; McVie, unable to gather funds to find a place in the world of visual arts, took her teaching diploma to London where she worked briefly as a department store window dresser for Regent Street department store. However, after learning Webb and Silvester were scouting a pianist to join their band, Chicken Shack, she wrote them with request to join--they invited her to play keyboards/piano and to sing backing vocals. Chicken Shack debuted with It's Okay With Me Baby, written by and featuring McVie. With two albums in, Chicken Shack found success with I'd Rather Go Blind, a song originally recorded by Etta James in 1967. The song featured McVie on lead vocals. McVie earned a Melody Maker award for female vocalist of the year and lauded for having one of the top 10 pairs of legs in all of Britain. While touring with Chicken Shack, the band would often meet with Fleetwood Mac (they shared the same label at Blue Horizon). Fleetwood Mac asked her to play piano as a session musician for Peter Green's songs on the band's second album, Mr. Wonderful. McVie left Chicken Shack after marrying Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie. She continued her career with the recording of a solo album, Christine Perfect; following her success as a member of Fleetwood Mac, the album was reissued under the name of the Legendary Christine Perfect Album. By the time she had joined Fleetwood Mac full-time, she had already contributed backup vocals and painted the cover for Kiln House (the fourth studio album recorded by Fleetwood Mac). Peter Green had left the band, leaving Fleetwood Mac with reservations to perform live without him. Having been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac; and versed in all the lyrics to their songs, she joined in. In 1974, with the band, McVie reluctantly relocated to the United States in effort to make a fresh start. Within a year, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined the band. With a new lineup, their first album together, titled Fleetwood Mac, found success with McVie's songs Over My Head and Say You Love Me both reaching Billboard's top-20 singles chart. The band sold 4 million copies of Fleetwood Mac and over 15 million of its follow-up, Rumours. From the album, McVie's You Make Loving Fun found a place on the top-10, and Don't Stop peaked to the #3, and years later became the song President Bill Clinton played for his Presidential campaign, and at his 1993 inaugural Gala (McVie and her band mates performed there, as well as as the Super Bowl a few days later). The success of Rumours earned the band many accolades; however, by the end of touring for the album, McVie divorced from John Mcvie. In 1979, the band released Tusk, the album was considered a disappointment, merely because it was impossible for any future releases to meet the success of Rumours. Three years later, the band reunited to record Mirage, which featured the top-5 hit Hold Me; McVie's inspiration for the song was her tumultuous relationship with Dennis Wilson, the drummer for the The Beach Boys. Wilson drowned in accident a few years later, leaving McVie heartbroken. In 1984, McVie released her second solo album, simply titled, Christine McVie. The album featured the hit Got a Hold on Me, positioning in the Top 10 pop, and #1 adult contemporary. She also met keyboardist Eddy Quintela (12 years her junior), they married two years later (October 1986). Although they divorced a decade later, they wrote several songs together, including Little Lies and As Long as You Follow, two songs that became hits for Fleetwood Mac. The solo album also features McVie's cover of Elvis Presley's Can't Help Falling In Love, the song was featured in the Howie Mandel film A Fine Mess (1986). A year later, she reunited with Fleetwood Mac for the recording of the band's fourteenth studio album, Tango in the Night. The album went on to become the band's biggest success since Rumours, ten years earlier. Always reluctant to tour, preferring to stay close to home and friends and family, and upon the death of her father, (while she was touring for Behind the Mask) (Fleetwood Mac's fifteenth studio album), McVie made the decision to retire from touring altogether. In 1998, she reunited with the band for the release of the live album, the Dance, which reached #1 on the US album charts. The same year, despite her reservations, she toured with the band for the group's 1998 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the Grammy Awards show, and the BRIT Awards. McVie returned to England to be near her family and stayed out of public view until 2000, when she appeared to accept an Honorary Doctorate in music from the University of Greenwich. 2000 also saw the release of In the Meantime, McVie's third solo album. No tour was organized, but McVie delivered several press interviews in both Britain and the United States. In 2013, she appeared on stage in Maui, Hawaii performing with the Mick Fleetwood Blues Band (her first live appearance in 15 years). Later in September, McVie performed live with Fleetwood Mac in London (also, for the first time in 15 years) to perform Don't Stop. Shortly after, Mick Fleetwood announced during a concert in Maui that McVie would be rejoining the band, it was officially announced two days later, she had rejoined. The original Rumours lineup (Nicks, Buckingham, Fleetwood, McVie, and McVie). In June, 2017, McVie teamed up with Lindsey Buckingham for the recording and release of Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie; the album sold over 22,000 units in the US in its first week and debuted within the top 20.

He grew up with his older brother Merle Allin and his mother Arleta, with whom he seemed to have a love/hate relationship. His father, Merle Sr., was a backwoods man who, according to GG, wanted to kill the family in a murder/suicide pact. Shortly before Allin started school, his mother changed his legal name to Kevin Michael Allin (on March 2, 1962 by his birth certificate) in order to give Allin a chance at a normal, mockery-free childhood. To escape his family and small-town environment, Allin turned to punk rock. Influenced by Iggy Pop, the MC5, Alice Cooper , and the Ramones, Allin played simple but catchy music. Originally a drummer, Allin switched to lead vocals and began his career as one of the most notorious singers in punk rock history. Beginning with the Jabbers, Allin was an energetic singer who fought with the audience, cut himself up with glass, and routinely found himself banned from most clubs in New England. Allin also suffered through a failed marriage and also fathered a child in this time. Allin's thirst for notoriety, combined with his hatred for almost everyone, caused him to transform himself into the most vile, sickening and fear-spreading character in rock history. Along with the fights and self-mutilation came on-stage defecation and urination (as well as the eating/drinking of it), attempted sexual assault of female audience members, brutal fights with other members of the audience, drug/alcohol abuse, nudity, etc. His bands included the Scumf*cs, the Texas Nazis and the Murder Junkies. Allin was jailed over 60 times for his onstage antics, and spent over 4 years in prison for assault and subsequent parole violations. In 1993, after a final gig at the Gas Station in New York City, (which saw Allin deliver 2 songs - I Am The Highest Power and Look Into My Eyes and Hate Me), a near-riot broke out, and Allin escaped from the police officers who were called to the club. Allin apparently overdosed on heroin while staying with friend Johnny Puke and died in his sleep.

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as Blowin' in the Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin' became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single Like a Rolling Stone, recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Dylan's mid-1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.#R##N##R##N#wikipedia Talk:Bob Dylan/Archive 8 - ... His Turkish ethnicity#R##N##R##N#... This quote comes from Bob Dylan's very own book in 'Chronicles: Volume One'. He says the following: My grandmother's ancestors had been from Constantinople. As a teenager, I used to sing the Ritchie Valens song 'In a Turkish Town' with the lines in it about the 'mystery Turks and the stars above,' and it seemed to suit me more than 'La Bamba.' (pg. 93).

Stone in 1915, and had an older brother, Vernon. Two younger siblings followed, Lewis and Irene. All born in the US, they were the children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants Benjamin David Solemovitz (born 1883), who changed Solemovitz to Stone, and his wife Florence Sara nee Edelstein, herself one of ten children.#R##N##R##N#Taking Florence Sara first: the Florence who would become Bob Dylan\u2019s grandmother\u2014she and the other nine Edelstein children were in turn the sons and daughters of Benjamin Harold Edelstein (born 1870) and Lybba nee Jaffe, from Kovno (Kaunas) in Lithuania.

The sentence in the article acknowledges Dylan's version in Chronicles: In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kyrgyz and her family originated from Istanbul.#R##N##R##N#One problem is that the information on Anna's death certificate contradicts Dylan's version. The death certificate was signed by her oldest son Maurice (Bob Dylan's uncle), and it states that she was born in Odessa.

Her death certificate, with the information supplied by Uncle Maurice, confirmed that she\u2019d been born in Odessa. Dylan contradicts this, writing in Chronicles: Volume One of visiting her when she still lived in Duluth: she \u2018had only one leg and had been a seamstress. \u2026 She\u2019d come to America from Odessa.[but] Originally she\u2019d come from Turkey, sailed from Trabzon, a port town, across the Black Sea. . . .

The genre has various standard tropes, such as reality TV confessionals used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration. In competition-based reality shows, a notable subset, there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode, a panel of judges, and the concept of immunity from elimination. The genre may have begun in earnest in 1991 with the Dutch series Nummer 28, which was the first show to bring together strangers and record their interactions. It then exploded as a phenomenon in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the global success of the series Survivor and Big Brother.

David Bowie made popular music for nearly 50 years. He was known for writing innovative, experimental work that was also commercially and critically successful. He is considered one of the most influential rock artists of all time and has had 9 platinum albums in the UK and 5 in the US. He was born David Robert Jones on January 8, 1947, in London, England. He developed an early interest in music and was already playing the saxophone at the age of 13. He soon started a career as a commercial artist, singing and playing with rock bands in his spare time. By 1966 he recorded several singles with three different groups. He eventually set out on his own, first catching the eye and ear of the public in July 1969 with his song Space Oddity. The single became so popular that it reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart. The same year, he formed his own mime troupe, Feathers, as well as an experimental art ensemble. This was the time when he adopted the stage name, David Bowie, mainly to avoid confusion with Davy Jones (of pop group The Monkees). Not being as commercially successful as he expected, Bowie inked a deal to record an album, which included the offbeat 'Space Oddity'. Bowie's next effort, 1970s The Man Who Sold the World, was a move toward a harder rock sound. Two years later, he finally made his big breakthrough with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars, a concept album about a sexually ambiguous rock star from outer space. Bowie, who was famous for his campy cross-dressing and different colored eyes, achieved his first major American crossover success in 1976 with the number-one single Fame and the hit album Young Americans. The same year, he also appeared on the big screen in the feature The Man Who Fell to Earth, a film that was a modest box-office success. Next, he teamed up with musician Brian Eno to work on albums called Berlin Trilogy, all reaching the UK top five and receiving lasting critical praise. He truly won the world with subsequent hit singles like Ashes to Ashes (1980), Under Pressure (a 1981 collaboration with Queen) and the several hits spawned by the 1983 album Let's Dance. In the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, his latest studio album The Next Day being released in March 2013. Thanks to his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and eclecticism of his work, he will be best remembered as a major figure in the world of popular music. Unfortunately, David Bowie died on on January 10, 2016 at the age of 69 after an 18 month battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife, the supermodel Iman, who he married in 1992. He also is survived by his son from his first wife, film director Duncan Jones and a daughter Alexandria Zahra Jones who was born in 2000.", "context": "Who follows vortigern, king of the britons? <EOS> The sex pistols <EOS> What is the religion?"}

He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as hardcore punk and metal. According to music critic Chris Brazier, Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out. The credo of one record label run by Laswell, and which typifies much of his work, is Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted. Though projects arranged by Laswell may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically: Material began as a noisy dance music project, but subsequent releases have been centered on hip hop, jazz, or backing spoken word readings by beat generation icon William S.

Brian Eno's impact on pop culture is indefinably vast. In addition to his net worth, he's acted as a creative muse or collaborator with some of the biggest artists in rock, such as David Bowie, David Byrne, U2, and more. He's also had a thriving and cultishly followed solo career that's spanned decades as well as multiple art forms. Eno's career as a professional musician began with the band Roxy Music. He started as a producer only, but eventually became a touring and performing member of the band, often putting on elaborate costumes for the shows. He quit the band after creative disputes, and started on a solo career both as a performer in albums like Here Come The Warm Jets and a producer and writer. One of his more famous works in this capacity is with David Bowie, with whom he wrote and contributed creatively to the Berlin trilogy of albums, which includes Low, Heroes, and Lodger. Despite the fact that Eno wasn't technically a producer on these albums, they definitely evince what would later be known as the Eno sound, with a lot of soaring electronic soundscapes and computerized beeps.
